## Day 1

Was doen in Ruby
Probably did not need the class could have done it in a Hash of Arrays but decided to model it  
just to get my feet wet
Also added a a pure datastructure soltuion in digest_datastruc.rb
TODO:
 - Can make the input file a argument (hardcoded to input.txt)
 - Can make the top N to check and argument (hardcoded to 3)
